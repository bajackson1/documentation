## All User Stories

- As a user, I want to see a list of all of the different academic buildings on the Mount Carmel campus with descriptions, so I can know more information about which building is which
- As a user, I want to save a list of buildings on campus, so I can refer to those buildings later
- As a user, I want to see my progress of where I have been on campus, so I can look back and refer to them for future purposes

## Final Overview

Each of these requirements were met and achieved exactly how we wanted, and then some. We especially went above and beyond on the favoriting and saving side of the project by implementing a pinning feature that allows user input to type in their desired building, an autocomplete feature for the pinning sequence, as well as using an interactive map from the Google API.

Overall, this project turned out almost exactly how we wanted it to. Each of the user stories were completed efficiently and on time for each of the presentations. Both of us had worked very hard on our respective sections we seemed to develop greatly in. Brooks did a very good job in the interactions and database usage, and Cole did a great job on the UI and the overall planning of the navigation.

Our biggest challenge we faced was getting over the hurdle of the very 1st implementation, since some of the presentation did not meet requirements. The ERD and UML diagram was not correct at first, but once we fixed those it was smooth sailing.

Overall, our communication and teamwork was amazing. We were constantly understanding of how much we could get done, as well as have a good grasp on our business outside of class. If we could start again, we would want to have all three types of buildings displayed in the first sprint, that way our later Sprints could be easier. This project was a great success, and we are very glad to have worked very hard on it.
