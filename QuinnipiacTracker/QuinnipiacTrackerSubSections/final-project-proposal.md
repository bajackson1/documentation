# Final Project Proposal

## Introduction

Our idea was to implement a travel-tracker type app, that will allow you to track the places you have been to on the Quinnipiac campus. This is based off of an app called been, which is a large-scale app that gives information about all the different countries in the world, and allows you to mark where you have been, lived, and want to go in the world. We loved this idea, and thought it would be useful for Quinnipiac students, and specifically for more experience being in different places on campus. We liked this idea for both Mount Carmel.

## Description

*been App Home Page*

We wanted the app to have the following features (for Mt. Carmel):

- Allow the user to list the places on campus they’ve been to
- Keep progress of all of the user’s building status
- Show a list all of the different buildings with descriptions
- Show a list all of the residence halls with descriptions
- Show a list all of the dining halls with descriptions
- Show a map of the campus

## Initial Mockup
