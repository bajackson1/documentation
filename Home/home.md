# Documentation

Welcome to my documentation website! This website will have documentation for my school projects. I originally had been putting individual PDFs in each repository but figured that making a place to house all of the data would A) be easier than making a new PDF each time and B) have a place (like a portfolio) where everything can be viewed.

On the left you will find a list of the collaborative projects I have worked on during my time at Quinnipiac University, each with a link to the project's GitHub repository as well as the documentation.

If you wish to check out more of my work, you can check out my [portfolio website](https://bjaxqq.github.io).
