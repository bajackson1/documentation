## Project Description

For the final project in the SER210 class (Android development with Kotlin), we were tasked with creating our own original app with all the tools we had learned throughout the semester. Cole and I brainstormed some ideas such as a fitness tracker and a to-do list maker, however we landed on something more close to home: a tracker for buildings the user has visited at Quinnipiac University.

Our main source of inspiration is the [been](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/been/id680148327) app. The premise of been is to track what countries, states, and regions of the world the user has "been" to. I had previously used the app for my own world travel tracking, and after looking through apps on my phone for inspiration I landed on this one. This is noted in our first document, the original app proposal.

Below is a table of contents containing all of the individual documents from the progress of our project. Since we were working in a SCRUM/Agile cycle for development, we needed to make project planning documents and presentations for each sprint, so I have placed each one of those in its own window.
