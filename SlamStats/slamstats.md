## Project Description

After learning about REST APIs and their implementation with JSON and Kotlin in class, we were tasked with creating an app based around an API of our choosing. The API was chosen from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub) due to the website's wide variety of API's to choose from as well as the easy endpoint code given to the user.

Cole and I are both big fans of basketball, so we wanted to make an app using some sort of basketball API. The specific API we chose was the [API-SPORTS' API-BASKETBALL](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-basketball). The endpoints we chose were the teams, the standings, the leagues, and the seasons. This way, the users would have an app in which they could input a league id number (given in the GitHub repository's README) and a specific season to get the standings from any season of any basketball league around the world.

Below you can access the document we used to work on the app. This is a very basic document as it is just meant for planning stuff out, but nonetheless it is a good indicator of our thought process and progression.
