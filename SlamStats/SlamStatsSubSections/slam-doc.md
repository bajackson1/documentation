# SlamStats Planning Document

## Weekly Planning

### Week 1

- Meet up throughout the week to continue to work on the project/get the main parts started
- We will do this by creating a git repo, meeting up in study rooms, and generally talking throughout the week to meet up together
- Continue to show up to class to work on it and ask any necessary questions

### Week 2

- Try and meet most days, especially before the easter “break”
- Try and finish before deadline to get it out of the way
- Continue to show up to class to work on it and ask any necessary questions

## Code Snippets and Ideas

- Continue to test endpoints with given code, works in RapidAPI site
- Write the 4 functions planned (Both):
  - `getTeam()`: takes the team value printed out and displays it on screen
  - `getLeague()`: takes the league value printed out and displays it on screen
  - `getRanking()`: takes the rank value printed out and displays it on screen
  - `getGroup()`: takes the group (East/West) value printed out and displays it on screen
- Work on UI (Both):
- Use base made in Canva, and get the basics done for it out of the way
- Implement toolbar and recycleView
- Continue to update it
